## API Keys and Docs
The [Binance API Documentation](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#introduction) can be found here, and the [Binance Spot Test Network](https://testnet.binance.vision/)
website can be found at this link. Both sites contain a lot of helpfull information and
the steps for API keys generation.

## Warning!
This project was developed with the objective of practicing programming. The Bot was tested on Binance Spot Test Network, without real money. I **don't encourage** you to use it in a production environment with real money. Also, the strategy used in this project is just a sample, **not a recommendation**.
